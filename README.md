*What is the artifact (system) offering? (Summery of the system)
	The main purpose of this robotic system (Thorvald is the name of the robot) is to detect precisely the weeds nearby the crops and then spray herbicide in order to eradicate those to facilitate crop growth .Firstly, the robot is made auto-moveable inside the agricultural field avoiding collisions with objects as well as the walls present over there. Secondly, using RGBD-Camera mounted on its front part facing down and with the help of openCV-tools, weeds are detected and by conversion from camera coordinate to spray co-ordinate using ‘tf’ in ROS, spraying is done precisely over the weeds.
